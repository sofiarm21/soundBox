# soundBox
My Swift Playground WWDC18 scholarship application. Status: Accepted

## Welcome to the Sound Box!

 Here you can create engaging sounds, experiment with the gravity and the figures and see how it affects your melody.
 The rectangles are the drums, the circles are the bass, and the triangles and pentagons are the lead.
 Select a shape, add it to the box, and it will start bouncing.
 
Now it's time for you to play!
 * Set the `dy` [coordinate](glossary://coordinate)  to change the [gravitational force](glossary://gravitationalForce)
 * Set the [restitution](glossary://restitution) of each shape
 * Add the shapes to the box by tapping over them
 * In order to restart the game tap the restart button in the corner down on the right
 * You can impulse the figure just tapping over it
 
 Experiment with gravity to achieve fun and different sounds
 
Have fun! ðŸ˜‹
